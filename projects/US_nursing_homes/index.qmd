In this project, I used the [Skilled Nursing Facility Cost Report](https://data.cms.gov/provider-compliance/cost-report/skilled-nursing-facility-cost-report) collected by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services in order to investigate characteristics of nursing homes in the United States. The dataset includes a wide range of information about nursing homes, including revenue, number of beds, and average stay duration.

**Alt-Text:** This choropleth plot displays the 48 contiguous US states colored by the number of nursing home beds available per 10,000 people. The data ranges from about 21 to 101 beds per 10,000 people. The western half of the US has a relatively low number of beds, while the Midwest has more. Iowa has the greatest number of beds. The data were obtained from the [Skilled Nursing Facility Cost Report](https://data.cms.gov/provider-compliance/cost-report/skilled-nursing-facility-cost-report) and [2020 Decennial Population Data](https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/articles/2022/04/25/a-third-of-states-lost-population-in-2021).

**Alt-Text:** This choropleth plot displays the 48 contiguous US states colored by the most common type of ownership for nursing homes in the state. The three types of ownership are Nonprofit, Proprietary and Governmental. All of the states are dominated by Proprietary nursing homes except for four: North Dakota, South Dakota and Minnesota have more Nonprofit nursing homes than other types and Indiana has more Governmental nursing homes. The data were obtained from the [Skilled Nursing Facility Cost Report](https://data.cms.gov/provider-compliance/cost-report/skilled-nursing-facility-cost-report).

  labs(x = "Gross Revenue",

```

Based on this analysis, two points were removed from the dataset.\
- **Twin Fountains Home (Georgia)** had a gross revenue of \$1,300,406,865\
- **Sanilac County Medical Care Facility (Michigan)** had 22,287 beds.
